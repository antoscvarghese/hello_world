exploring the github world

Hi Aliens,

 If you are reading this post that means yuo have put lot of efforts to find out small planet earth which is several light years away.
 If you can do that much then you can defenitely decode English and therefore hello nice to meet you. This is a small beining from me into the algorithmic world but surely every great thing had a small begining.
 
 See you soon.
